        <h1 class="blogtitle">#first blog!: visiting companies</h1>
        <h1 class="blogdate">06/27/16</h1>
        <p class="blogtext">
            Yay guys! First post! Welcome to my blogs which are 
            basically going to be like my digital diaries! They'll
            range from traveling adventures to food experiences to everything
            in between. So without further ado, let me present you
            my first blog post on visiting cool ass companies!
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            On June 23rd, I got to visit two major companies in the 
            tech business: Yelp and Github. It was an incredible 
            experience, to say the least. I encourage everyone to 
            try to get a tour around the companies because I got 
            amazing advice from amazing people. Huge thanks to Quinn 
            Slack from 
            <a class="bloglinks" href="https://sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph</a> 
            for giving us the idea & Zach from 
            <a class="bloglinks" href="https://camp.hackclub.com/">Hack Camp</a> 
            for helping me write it!

            First stop of the day: Yelp!  
        </p>

            Isn't the building beautiful? It used to be a old Pacific Bell 
            Building but now it is occupied by many businesses, Yelp being 
            one of them. 
        </p>

            The building is also super tall (I had to <i>really</i> bend my 5'2 
            self to take this picture.) 
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            Anyways, onwards! We had to pass through front desk security, and then 
            traveled <sub>up</sub> up <sup>up</sup> to the lobby! The lobby is 
            very cool, as expected.

        <p class="blogtext2">    
            I met with Jenni Snyder, the Engineering Manager at Yelp and one of the 
            co-leaders of their Awesome Women in Engineering (AWE) group, and she showed 
            us several floors of the building. All of these floors showed dedicated people
            hard at work and it really inspired me to work hard as well. On Jenni's floor, 
            we met with another member of AWE: Maria. Maria uses algorithms to make the 
            predictions in Yelp possible for the users. 
        </p> 
        <p class="blogtext2">
            After meeting up with Maria, we all went to a floor which was completely a chill 
            zone; it had a coffeeshop, plenty of open couches and chairs, and even a 80s-style 
            light-up wall decal.

        <p class="blogtext2">
            We began discussing about their daily life at work, how they 
            got there, and other interesting stuff. Jenni and Maria even got to see our projects 
            we made at Hack Camp! It was such a fun experience at Yelp and I wish I could do this
            all the time.
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            Next stop: Sushiritto! 
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            I have waited very long for this day. I only got to stare longlingly at it in pictures,
            hold in my hunger and desire, and imagine the day that I will go as well... And I 
            finally did! I got to <i>finally</i> try Sushiritto. 
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            Jiabei, my friend who went with me, and I searched for Sushiritto, which my Yelp app informed
            was only 0.2 miles away from the building and should only take 2 minutes. Funny thing, we got 
            lost and it took us almost 10 minutes to find the famous sushi place. There was already a huge 
            line snaking out from the tiny shop, but the wait was worth. At first, I had thought Sushiritto 
            was customizable like Chipotle but it turned out to be already pre-designed. I chose the Sumo 
            Crunch, which had tempura, crab meat, and their "special" green guac all rolled up with a crunchy
            red crumbs shell.

        <p class="blogtext2">
            Final stop: Github!
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext2">
            Last stop of the day was Github, where all of our projects are stored! We met with Natalie and 
            another lady who were on the marketing team and took care of the Github shop. Github was 
            generous in letting us collect unlimited stickers from their sticker bowls and giving us a free 
            T-shirt as well!
